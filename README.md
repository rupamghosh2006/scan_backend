## ðŸ”¹ Problem Statement  

Traditional online testing tools, such as Google Forms, while convenient, often fall short when it comes to **efficiency, security, and automation** in conducting academic assessments.  

A mathematics teacher faced the following challenges in managing class tests:  

1. **Manual Test Creation**  
   - Every time a test was scheduled, the teacher had to manually create a new Google Form.  
   - Uploading questions, setting options, and formatting were highly **time-consuming and repetitive**.  

2. **Lack of Security in Google Forms**  
   - Google Forms provided minimal control over **cheating prevention**.  
   - Students could easily share forms, reattempt using multiple accounts, or collaborate during tests.  
   - No proctoring or monitoring features were available.  

3. **Inefficient Question Management**  
   - There was no **centralized question bank**. Each test had to be created from scratch.  
   - If the teacher had a collection of previous question papers (images or PDFs), there was no direct way to reuse or digitise them.  

4. **Test Randomization & Scheduling Limitations**  
   - All students received the same set of questions, making it easier to share answers.  
   - There was no mechanism to **automatically randomise questions** or generate **unique sets for each student**.  
   - Google Forms lacked proper **test scheduling and automation** features.  

5. **Post-Test Analysis Limitations**  
   - The teacher needed a **leaderboard** to instantly evaluate student performance in a comparative format.  
   - Downloading and sharing results in a professional format like **PDF** was not directly supported.

## ðŸ”¹ Client Requirements  

To overcome these challenges, the teacher envisioned a **dedicated web application** with the following requirements:  

- **Teacher Dashboard**  
  - Upload questions in **image or PDF** format.  
  - An integrated **OCR system** (Optical Character Recognition) to automatically recognise and digitise content.  
  - Store extracted questions in a **centralised question bank** for easy reuse.  

- **Test Management & Scheduling**  
  - Option to schedule tests in advance.  
  - Automatic generation of **randomised question sets** for each student, ensuring fairness and reducing chances of cheating.  

- **Student Security Features**  
  - Enhanced exam security measures such as:  
    - Restricted navigation.  
    - Random question shuffling.  

- **Result Processing & Leaderboard**  
  - Automatic evaluation of tests.  
  - A downloadable **leaderboard view** for teachers to instantly compare students' performance.
